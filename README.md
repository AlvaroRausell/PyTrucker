# PyTrucker
__A flawless driver with no flaws whatsoever__

Automated driver program made in Python. This algorithm was intended to drive autonomously in the game Euro Truck Simulator.
For this, openCV was used to identify the main lanes and obstacles. Afterwards, some conditions would be established for the 
driver to react. 

As a future iteration, improved image processing must be done, as well as a more sopisticated decision-making engine, such as
neural networks.
